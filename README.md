## The Live Coding Synth for Everyone.

Sonic Pi is an open source programming environment originally designed
to explore and teach programming concepts through the process of
creating new sounds. Sonic Pi comes with an associated scheme of work
which emphasises the importance of creativity in the learning process
and gives users the control to turn their sonic ideas into reality.

However, in addition to being an engaging education resource it's also
evolved into an extremely powerful and performance-ready live coding
instrument.

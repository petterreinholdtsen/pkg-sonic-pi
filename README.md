## The Live Coding Synth for Everyone.

Sonic Pi is a *new kind of musical instrument*. Instead of strumming
strings or whacking things with sticks - you write code - **live**.

Sonic Pi has been designed with the aim to find a harmonious balance
between three core principles:

* **Simple** enough for the 10 year old within you
* **Joyful** enough for you to lose yourself through play
* **Powerful** enough for your own expressions

Sonic Pi is a complete open source programming environment originally
designed to explore and *teach programming concepts* within schools through 
the process of creating *new sounds*. 

In addition to being an engaging education resource it has evolved into 
an *extremely powerful* and performance-ready *live coding instrument* suitable 
for professional artists and DJs.

Whilst Education is a core focus it now sits at the intersection
between three core domains:

* **Art** - providing the means to express yourself and ask new questions of music and notation
* **Technology** - exploring questions related to liveness, time and concurrency in programming languages
* **Education**  - demonstrating that open play rather than rigid structures increases motivation and engagement in the classroom

Again, finding a balance working to the best benefits of all these
domains is the objective.
